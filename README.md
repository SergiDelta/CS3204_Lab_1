CS3204 Cloud infrastructure and services - Lab 1: Virtual machines and containers

Laboratory Goals / Objectives:

Students will investigate the virtual machine and container technologies used in clouds, by 
creating virtual machines and containers on the lab desktops or their own laptops. Timing the 
execution of an application on the laptop/desktop and then by running it in the virtual 
machine and then in the container environments will give an indication of the differences in 
performance between VMs and containers.
